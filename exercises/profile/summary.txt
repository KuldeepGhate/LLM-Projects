My name is Kuldeep Ghate. I'm a, software engineer and marketing technologist. I'm originally from Pune, India, but I moved to California in 2014.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but I'm repelled by almost all forms of meat. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste and smell! I make an exception for fish and chicken though - sushi and shawarma are the greatest.
